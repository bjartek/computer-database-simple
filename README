This is a classic CRUD application, backed by a JDBC database. It demonstrates:

- Accessing a JDBC database, using Anorm.
- Achieving, table pagination and CRUD forms.
- Integrating with a CSS framework (Twitter Bootstrap ).

Twitter Bootstrap requires a different form layout to the default one that the Play 2.0 form helper generates, so this application also provides an example of integrating a custom form input constructor.

This example has been simplified from the standard example in play 2.0 in order to make the transition to mongodb easier to grasp.  The modifications are
 - deleted tests 
 - removed pagination
 - removed sorting of columns
